# Preface {.unnumbered}


**Learning outcomes**

- Explain the core principles of ensemble learning, including bagging, boosting, and stacking.
- Compare strengths and limitations of different ensemble approaches (e.g., Random Forest vs. XGBoost).
- Implement bagging and boosting models in R using randomForest and xgboost.
- Tune hyperparameters of ensemble models using validation data.
- Construct a stacking ensemble using predicted probabilities from multiple base learners.
- Train a meta-learner (e.g., logistic regression) to combine base model outputs.
- Evaluate and interpret performance metrics (accuracy, AUC) for individual models and ensembles.
