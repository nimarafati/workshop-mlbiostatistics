# Introduction

These exercises focus on more complicated grouped structures with more than one grouping level as well as statistical tests for mixed models.

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
## Load R packages
library(lme4) # To fit linear mixed models
library(tidyverse) # For data manipulation
library(ggplot2) # For visualization
```

# Nested design
## Mice in litters
  
We simulate data for mice nested within litters, which are themselves nested within breeding lines. Our aim is to evaluate the effect of a drug on mouse weight while accounting for the hierarchical grouping structure.
  
  
```{r}
## Data simulation
set.seed(42)

# Parameters
n_lines <- 5
n_litters_per_line <- 4
n_mice_per_litter <- 6

# Create data
nested_data <- expand.grid(
  line = factor(1:n_lines),
  litter = factor(1:n_litters_per_line),
  mouse = 1:n_mice_per_litter
) %>%
  mutate(
    litter_id = factor(paste(line, litter, sep=".")),
    drug = sample(c("control", "treated"), n(), replace = TRUE),
    line_effect = rnorm(n_lines, 0, 1)[as.integer(line)],
    litter_effect = rnorm(n_lines * n_litters_per_line, 0, 0.8)[as.integer(litter_id)],
    residual = rnorm(n(), 0, 1),
    drug_effect = ifelse(drug == "treated", -2, 0),
    weight = 25 + drug_effect + line_effect + litter_effect + residual
  )
```

Visualize the data, e.g. using boxplots and jitter plots, both overall and showing the line and litter.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code

```{r fig-drugweight}
#| fig-cap: "Weight by Drug Treatment"
ggplot(nested_data, aes(x = drug, y = weight)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r fig-litterdrugweight}
#| fig-cap: "Weight by Litter and Drug Treatment"
ggplot(nested_data, aes(x = litter_id, y = weight, color = drug, shape=line)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(title = "Weight by Litter", x = "Line.Litter") +
  theme_bw()
```
:::

Fit three different models;

0. A linear regression model ignoring the grouping structure.
1. A linear mixed model with a random intercept for litter nested within line.
2. A linear mixed model with a random slope for drug treatment per litter, nested within line.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code

```{r}
# Model 1: Ignore nesting
m0 <- lm(weight ~ drug, data = nested_data)

# Model 2: Random intercept for litter (nested within line)
m1 <- lmer(weight ~ drug + (1 | line/litter_id), data = nested_data)
# Compare to this notation
m1_alt <- lmer(weight ~ drug + (1|line) + (1 | litter_id:line), data = nested_data)

# Model 3: Add random slope for drug per line
m2 <- lmer(weight ~ drug + (1 + drug | line/litter_id), data = nested_data)
```
:::

Use `summary()` to study the different models and `anova()` to compare the two linearmixed models with different random effects.
  
:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code

```{r}
summary(m0)
summary(m1)
summary(m2)
```

```{r}
anova(m1, m2, refit= FALSE)
```
:::
  
  1. Why is model 1 more appropriate than model 0?
  2. For the random intercept model 1, does line or litter account for more variation in weight?
  3. Does adding a random slope for `drug` improve the model fit?**
  4. Based on the best model, what is the estimated fixed effect of the drug treatment? Interpret it.
  

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solutions
  
1. **Model `m1` accounts for the nested structure**—ignoring it can underestimate standard errors and inflate Type I error.

2. The `VarCorr(m1)` output shows variance estimates for line and litter. These tell us how much of the total variance in weight is due to those grouping levels.

```{r}
# Variance components for model m1
print(VarCorr(m1), comp="Variance")
```


3. **Compare AIC and p-value from the ANOVA.** If model `m2` doesn’t improve AIC much or the p-value is large, the added complexity is not justified.

4. From `summary(m1)`, the fixed effect of `drugtreated` is approximately `-2.3`, indicating that treatment lowers weight by 2g on average.

## Lab, technician and sample

We will use the `faraway` package to analyze a dataset with a nested structure of lab, technician, and sample. The dataset `eggs` contains measurements of fat content in egg powder.
Four samples, 2 G samples and 2 H samples, were analyzed by six laboratories, each with two technicians. The samples were each divided into two parts and fat content meassured in each. The goal is to assess the effect of lab and technician on the fat content.

```{r}
# Load the faraway package and the eggs dataset
library(faraway)
data("eggs", package = "faraway")
# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(eggs)
```

Visualize the data.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Fat content by Lab and Technician"
eggs |> ggplot(aes(x= Lab, y = Fat, color = Technician, shape=Sample)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  theme_bw()
```
:::

What is the grouping structure and how is it nested. Using this information fit a linear mixed model.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
Sample is nested within Technician, which is nested within Lab.
:::

There are multiple ways to specify the random effects structure, use the method that is least confusing to you!

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code

```{r}
##These two models are equivalent, try it!
mfat <- lmer(Fat ~ Sample + (1|Lab/Technician/Sample), data = eggs)
mfat <- lmer(Fat ~ Sample + (1|Lab) + (1|Lab:Technician) + (1|Lab:Technician:Sample), data = eggs)
```
:::

Examine the model output and interpret the random effects. At what level is the most variation in fat content?

# Model comparisons
## Orthodont

Let's get back to the `Orthodont` dataset in the `nlme` package, which contains measurements of 27 children's teeth growth over time.

```{r ortho, message=FALSE}
library(nlme)
data("Orthodont", package = "nlme")
summary(Orthodont)
```

When assessing the change of `distance` with increased `age` it is important to take the grouping structure into account. Each child is measured multiple times, so we need to account for the correlation of measurements within subjects. Add a random intercept for subject and fit a linear mixed model to assess the association between distance and age.

```{r}
mo1 <- lmer(distance ~ age + (1|Subject), data = Orthodont)
summary(mo1)
```

There are both boys and girls in the dataset. Subjects are nested within sex. Take this nested grouping structure into account and fit a linear mixed model with random intercept.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code

```{r}
##mo2 <- lmer(distance ~ age + (1|Sex/Subject), data = Orthodont)
mo2 <- lmer(distance ~ age + (1|Sex) + (1|Sex:Subject), data = Orthodont)
summary(mo2)
```
:::

Add also random slope for age, first only per sex, then both in sex and subject (nested within sex).

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code

```{r}
mo3 <- lmer(distance ~ age + (1 + age|Sex) + (1|Sex:Subject), data = Orthodont)
mo4 <- lmer(distance ~ age + (1 + age|Sex) + (1+age|Sex:Subject), data = Orthodont)
```
:::

Use likelihood ratio test to compare the four models. Use the significance threshold of 0.05.
What does the results tell you, which model would you choose?

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code

```{r}
## LRT
anova(mo1, mo2, mo3, mo4, refit = FALSE)
```
:::

Your PI changes their mind, they want to estimate the effect of sex on the distance. How could you do this? With random intercept per subject, build models with different sets of fixed effects. Start with only intercept and age, then add also sex and finally also the interaction between age and sex.

```{r}
mo1 <- lmer(distance ~ age + (1|Subject), data = Orthodont)
mof2 <- lmer(distance ~ age + Sex + (1|Subject), data = Orthodont)
mof3 <- lmer(distance ~ age*Sex + (1|Subject), data = Orthodont)
```

Compare the models using likelihood ratio test. Use the `anova`function and remember to set `refit=TRUE` to use ML and not REML!

What do the results tell you? Which model would you choose?

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code

```{r}
anova(mo1, mof2, mof3, refit = TRUE)
```

# Computing p-values for mixed models

In this section you will use the `lmerTest` package to compute p-values for mixed models using Satterthwaite's approximation. This package extends the `lme4` package and provides functions to compute p-values for fixed effects in linear mixed models.

Go back to the exercises "Drug effect on blood pressure" and "Sleep study" from the this morning and use the `lmerTest` package to compute p-values for the fixed effects in the models you fitted.

# Logistic mixed model

Here we will use the `ohio` dataset in the `faraway` package. This dataset contains information on 537 children and their wheezing status, a binary variable indicating if the child has a pulmonary problem or nor). Each child multiple observations (one for each year from ages 7 to 10, where age 9 is coded as 0). There is also an indicator variable for whether the mother of the child is a smoker.

Take a look at the first two children;

```{r}
library(faraway)
data("ohio", package = "faraway")
head(ohio, 8)
```

What would the grouping structure be in this case?

If we ignore the grouping structure, we can fit a logistic regression model using `glm()`:

```{r glm}
mohio_glm <- glm(resp ~ age + smoke, family = binomial, data = ohio)
summary(mohio_glm)
```

To compute the odds ratios (OR), we exponentiate the coefficients:

```{r}
exp(coef(mohio_glm))
```

According to this model, does the odds for wheezing increase or decrease with age? What about smoking? Are any of the effects statistically significant?

The above model is however incorrect as it ignores the fact that each child has multiple observations. To take this grouping into account, we can use a mixed model with a random intercept for each child.

```{r}
mohio <- glmer(resp ~ age + smoke + (1|id), family=binomial, data=ohio)
summary(mohio)
```

We compute the ORs;

```{r}
exp(fixef(mohio))
```

According to this model, does the odds for wheezing increase or decrease with age? What about smoking? Are any of the effects statistically significant?
